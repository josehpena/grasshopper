Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example (Input -> Output):

2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)


1 # Think of a test case for when a zero is sent - OK

2 # Should return number one when the number one is sent - OK

3 # When the number two is sent, calculate the sum of 2 houses progressively starting from 1 - OK
